# HEY-Honoring-Exalting-Yeshua
HEY is a movement devoted to placing Yeshua (Jesus) at the center of our lives. Our mission is simple yet profound: to Honor and Exalt the name of Yeshua (Jesus) through authentic worship, bold faith, and unwavering love.  HEY exists to lift high the name above all names. We believe that when Yeshua is exalted, lives are transformed.
